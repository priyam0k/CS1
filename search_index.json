Use appropriate tools to calculate suitable summary statistics and undertake exploratory data visualizations. Define and calculate Pearson’s, Spearman’s and Kendall’s measures of correlation for bivariate data, explain their interpretation and perform statistical inference as appropriate. Use Principal Components Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of a complex data set. Theory 7.0.0.1 1. Purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis EDA is the process of analysing data to gain initial insights into its nature, patterns, and relationships between variables before formal statistical techniques are applied. Its primary aim is to understand “what is going on” with the data, summarising it into a more easily understood format. 7.0.0.2 2. Tools for Summary Statistics and Data Visualisation EDA employs various tools depending on the number of variables: For Univariate Data (Single Variable): Summary Statistics: Measures of central tendency: Mean, Median, Mode. Measures of dispersion: Standard Deviation, Interquartile Range (IQR), Range, Skewness. Graphical Displays: Line plots. Bar charts (for discrete or categorical data). Histograms (for continuous data, where bar area represents frequency). Stem and leaf diagrams (displaying distribution and aiding quartile identification). Cumulative frequency graphs (for estimating percentiles). Boxplots (Box and Whisker Plots) (showing lowest/highest values, median, quartiles; useful for comparing datasets). Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots. For Bivariate or Multivariate Data (Multiple Variables): Summary Statistics: Individual variable summary statistics. Graphical Displays: Scatterplots (to visualise relationships between pairs of variables). 7.0.0.3 3. Correlation Measures for Bivariate Data These coefficients quantify the strength and direction of relationships between variables: Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (r): Definition: Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables. Formula: \\(r = \\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x . s_y}\\) Interpretation: Values range from -1 to +1. Near +1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship, near -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship, and near 0 indicates no linear correlation. Statistical Inference: A t-distribution based test is available for the hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient (ρ) is zero. Fisher’s transformation can be used for testing hypotheses about specific non-zero values of ρ. Crucial Caveat: Correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient (r_s): Definition: Measures the strength of a monotonic (not necessarily linear) relationship between two variables. Calculation: Applied by calculating Pearson’s formula on the ranks of the data. Statistical Inference: Tests exist for both small samples (using permutations of ranks) and medium to large samples (using an approximate Normal distribution). Kendall’s Rank Correlation Coefficient (τ): Definition: Another non-parametric measure of monotonic association, based on the number of concordant and discordant pairs in the data. Statistical Inference: Similar to Spearman’s, tests are available for small samples (permutations) and medium to large samples (using an approximate Normal distribution). 7.0.0.4 4. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) Purpose: PCA is a method for reducing the dimensionality of a complex dataset by identifying the key components necessary to model and understand the data. Mechanism: It creates uncorrelated linear combinations of the original variables, where these new components (principal components) maximise the variance explained. Process: Calculate the centred data. Obtain eigenvectors of the scaled covariance matrix, which represent the “rotation” of the data. Compute the principal components, which are the new uncorrelated variables. Evaluate the explanatory power (variance) of each component. Reduce the number of components by discarding those that explain less variance. Reconstruct the original data using the reduced set of components. Component Selection Criteria: Cumulative Variance Explained: Retain components that collectively explain a target percentage (e.g., 90%) of the total variance. Scree Test: Plot a scree diagram and keep components before the graph “levels off”. Kaiser Criterion: If data is scaled, keep components whose variance is greater than 1.
