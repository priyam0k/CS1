## Learning Objectives {-#objectives-data-analysis}

1. Describe the possible aims of a data analysis (e.g. descriptive, inferential, and predictive).
2. Describe the stages of conducting a data analysis to solve real-world problems in a scientific manner and describe tools suitable for each stage.
3. Describe sources of data and explain the characteristics of different data sources, including extremely large data sets.
4. Explain the meaning and value of reproducible research and describe the elements required to ensure a data analysis is reproducible.

## Theory {-#theory-data-analysis}

### 1. Definition and Purpose
*   **Data analysis** is the process of gathering raw data and then analysing or processing it into information that can be used for specific purposes.
*   The overall basis of this course involves dealing with data, such as claim types and amounts, and summarising and analysing them to construct statistical models for predictions.

#### 2. Key Forms of Data Analysis
Data analysis primarily takes three forms:
*   **Descriptive Analysis**: Involves summarising data into a simpler, more easily understood format using summary statistics (e.g., measures of central tendency like mean, median, mode; and measures of dispersion like standard deviation, interquartile range, skewness) and graphical displays. It aims to describe the data presented, not to draw specific conclusions.
*   **Inferential Analysis**: Draws conclusions about a population based on data gathered from a sample. It involves estimating population parameters and testing hypotheses, often assuming large, randomly selected samples accurately represent the wider population.
*   **Predictive Analysis**: Extends inferential analysis principles to analyse past data and make predictions about future events. This often involves using a "training set" to identify relationships and a "test set" to assess their strength, with regression analysis being a typical example.

#### 3. The Data Analysis Process
The key steps in a data analysis process are sequential and systematic:
1.  **Develop clear objectives** for the analysis.
2.  **Identify required data items**.
3.  **Collect data from appropriate sources**.
4.  **Process and format data** (e.g., inputting into spreadsheets or databases).
5.  **Clean data** by addressing unusual, missing, or inconsistent values.
6.  **Conduct exploratory data analysis** (which may include descriptive, inferential, or predictive analysis).
7.  **Model the data**.
8.  **Communicate the results**.
9.  **Monitor the process** by updating data and repeating analysis if necessary.

#### 4. Types of Data
Data can be categorised to define how it should be summarised and analysed:
*   **Numerical (Quantitative) Data**: Consists of numbers or quantities.
    *   **Discrete Data**: Can only take particular whole values (e.g., number of claims). Typically obtained by counting.
    *   **Continuous Data**: Can take any value within a specified range (e.g., claim amount, time). Typically obtained by measuring and often rounded.
*   **Categorical (Qualitative) Data**: Consists of non-numerical information.
    *   **Attribute (Dichotomous) Data**: Has only two categories (e.g., claim/no claim).
    *   **Nominal Data**: Cannot be ordered in any way (e.g., hair colour, policy type).
    *   **Ordinal Data**: Can be ordered (e.g., tidiness ratings, agreement levels).

#### 5. Summarising Data
*   **In Tables**:
    *   **Frequency Distributions**: Show how frequencies are shared amongst data values. Suitable for categorical or discrete numerical data.
    *   **Grouped Frequency Distributions**: Organise data into classes or groups, suitable for continuous data where values are spread out.
    *   **Cumulative Frequency Tables**: Accumulate (add up) frequencies, useful for finding positions of data values like the median.
*   **In Diagrams**:
    *   **Bar Charts**: Used for discrete or categorical data, displaying frequency with bars that have gaps between them.
    *   **Histograms**: Used for continuous data, similar to bar charts but with a continuous x-axis and no gaps between bars. The *area* of each bar represents the frequency, requiring calculation of **frequency density** (frequency / class width) for bar height.
    *   **Stem and Leaf Diagrams**: Split each data value into a "stem" (e.g., tens) and a "leaf" (e.g., units). Useful for showing data distribution and finding quartiles.
    *   **Cumulative Frequency Graphs**: Plot the cumulative frequency against the upper class boundary of each group, useful for estimating percentiles.
    *   **Boxplots (Box and Whisker Plots)**: Display the lowest value, highest value, median, lower quartile (Q1), and upper quartile (Q3). They effectively show the middle 50% of data and are useful for comparing data sets.

#### 6. Comparing Data Sets
When comparing data sets, focus on three key features:
*   **Location**: Where the data is centred or grouped (e.g., using mean, median, mode).
*   **Spread**: How spread out or variable the values are (e.g., using range, interquartile range, standard deviation).
*   **Skewness (Shape)**: The asymmetry of the distribution (positively skewed, symmetrical, or negatively skewed).

#### 7. Data Management Principles
*   **Data Sources**: **Primary source** is the original population or sample. A **secondary source** makes this collected information available for others.
*   **Data Characteristics**:
    *   **Censored Data**: The value of a variable is only partially known (e.g., a lower bound in survival studies).
    *   **Truncated Data**: Measurements are completely unknown as they were not recorded.
    *   **Big Data**: Characterised by:
        *   **Volume**: Size of the data set.
        *   **Velocity**: Speed of data arrival and processing.
        *   **Variety**: Data from many different sources and formats.
        *   **Veracity/Reliability**: Difficulty in ascertaining reliability of individual data elements.

#### 8. Reproducibility
*   **Replication** refers to an independent third party repeating an experiment and obtaining consistent results. It can be difficult if studies are large, rely on expensive data, or involve unique occurrences.
*   **Reproducibility** refers to ensuring an analysis can be precisely re-run, yielding the same results. This is often taken as a reasonable alternative standard to replication.
*   **Elements required for reproducibility** include original data, fully documented computer code, good version control, details of the software environment, and setting random seeds where randomness is involved.
*   **Value of Reproducibility**: Essential for technical review, regulatory compliance, extending research, comparison, and error reduction in actuarial analysis.
